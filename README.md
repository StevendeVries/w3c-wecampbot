Meet W3C, the WeCamp bot
------------------------

Hi, I'm W3C, short for W3Camp bot.

I can be expanded, just clone my repo and write a new command.
Take a look at src/WeCampBot/WhatTheCommit.php as an example.

1. Add your command to src/WeCampBot/[your command here].php
2. Load your command in bot.php
3. Add your command to the Help command: src/WeCampBot/Help.php

Make a PR...
If your PR is accepted, I will learn to do something new automatically!
